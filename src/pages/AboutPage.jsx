          My name is Allie Stewart.
          I was born and raised in central Texas.
          My interests include drawing, video games, videography,
          and programming.
          I started at the University of Texas in September 2023,
          in the Coding Bootcamp, in order to learn web development,
          database management, and various new programming languages to
          help me achieve my goals in software development.
