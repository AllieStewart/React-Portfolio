## What I Have Learned
I have learned the inner workings of React and how limitless it is. </br>
There's so many possibilities to site building that I get lost in what </br>
exactly to do... All I know is, I need to brush up on Bootstrap more. </br>

## Credits
Made by Allie Stewart. </br>
A lot of looking through the ol' Bootstrap docs </br>
at https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/ </br>
as well as glancing over past module 20 React applications from class. </br>
